# Airbnb Bookings Analysis Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Airbnb Bookings Analysis project repository! This project explores the intricate world of Airbnb bookings through an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The primary goal is to uncover valuable insights and trends within the dataset, shedding light on factors influencing booking patterns, user behavior, and pricing strategies. The project employs Python for data analysis and visualization, utilizing libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau.

## Project Structure
- **data/:** Contains the raw dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
  - `DATA EXPLORATION, WRANGLING & VISUALIZATIONS.ipynb`
- **tableau/:** Holds the Tableau workbook file (`airbnb_analysis.twb`) for interactive visualizations.
- **pdf/:** Includes key documents for the project.
  - `CONCLUSION.pdf`: Document providing project conclusions.
  - `PROBLEM STATEMENT.pdf`: Document outlining the problem statement.
  - `SOLUTION.pdf`: Document presenting the solution.
- **README.md:** Project documentation.


## Project Goals
### Understand Hosting Dynamics:
- Identify peak hosting periods.
- Discover popular listing types.
- Determine the average duration of stays.

### User Preferences:
- Investigate factors such as location, property type, amenities, and pricing.
- Provide insights into what guests value the most.

### Pricing Strategies:
- Explore the relationship between pricing and booking frequency.
- Identify optimal pricing ranges for different property types and locations.

### Location Analysis:
- Utilize geospatial data to visualize the distribution of Airbnb listings.
- Identify hotspots and understand regional variations in demand.
